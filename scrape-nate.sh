      bio: `# My Story

From Indonesia to Seattle, I've been on a journey to understand and build the future of AI.

My path started in Indonesia, where I first discovered my passion for technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. The journey brought me to Seattle, where I've immersed myself in the AI ecosystem, working with startups, building tools, and connecting with other innovators.

I believe we're at a critical inflection point in human history. AI isn't just another technologyâ€”it's a fundamental shift in how we work, create, and solve problems. But with great power comes great responsibility, and I'm committed to helping others navigate this landscape thoughtfully and effectively.

Through my writing, speaking, and community building, I aim to be a compass for others in the age of AI. Whether you're just starting your AI journey or you're a seasoned professional looking to stay ahead of the curve, I'm here to help you find your way.

When I'm not building or writing about AI, you can find me experimenting with new tools, mentoring others, or thinking about what comes next in this rapidly evolving field.`,
